0,agent1,agent2,"Assistant A correctly answers the user's question by stating that Bras√≠lia is the capital of Brazil, citing a relevant document [0] that directly answers the question. 

Assistant B, on the other hand, provides historical information about the capital of Brazil, stating that Rio de Janeiro used to be the capital until the 60s, citing document [1].

1,agent2,agent1,"Both Assistant A and Assistant B correctly answer the user's question, stating that Paris is the capital of France. They both cite the relevant document [2] to support their answers.

Therefore, while both assistants provide the correct answer, Assistant B's response is more concise and directly addresses the user's question without including unnecessary information. 

Based on these considerations, my final verdict is: [[B]].",B
1,agent1,agent2,"Both Assistant A and Assistant B correctly answer the user's question, stating that Paris is the capital of France. They both cite document [2] which is relevant to the user's question.

The difference between the two responses is that Assistant B also includes information from document [3] about Lyon being the second largest city in France. While this information is accurate, it is not relevant to the user's question about the capital of France.

Given that the user's question was specifically about the capital of France, Assistant A's response is more direct and to the point. Assistant B's response, while correct, includes additional information that does not answer the user's question.

Therefore, based on the correctness, relevance, and directness of the responses, the final verdict is: [[A]].",A
