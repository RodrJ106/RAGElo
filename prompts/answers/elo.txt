Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants tasked to answer the question displayed below, based on a set of documens retrieved by a search engine.

Answers cite documents using square brackets.  For each reference document, you will be provided with a reasoning explaining why the document is or is not relevant.

Begin your evaluation by explaining why each answer correctly answers the user question. Then, you should compare the two responses and provide a short explanation on their differences. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better, and "[[C]]" for a tie.
